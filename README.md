# 3 counties Bee keepers club page- my project. 
I have had trouble saving my changes. 
It migth be because I am using linux? 

My goal for this project is to get the page up and running. 
Once I have the basics done, I plan on regular updates and add to it as I learn more.
It will be in everyday use and the committee are anxious I get this up.
They view it as mostly a noticeboard and thing "that is needed because everyone has a webpage"
Unfortunately after brainstorming with the crew (average age 68),
I have been informed that simply having a page is all they want. 
So this is all on me. 
No preference for styles/design/colors. 
2 requirements. 1 use the club logo. 
                2 Everything BIG because the users are old and needs glasses
                (unofficial request, check photos for anything unflattering)

## code from previous projects. 
I have used code from previous projects in the style.css.
it is the modifications to the nav. colors and orientation has been changed to show I understand how the code works.

### Bootstrap help.
