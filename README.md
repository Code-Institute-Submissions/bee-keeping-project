# 3 counties Bee keepers club page- my project. 
I have had trouble saving my changes. 
My internet is great off peak, damn my netflix using neighbours. 

My goal for this project is to get the page up and running.
It will be in everyday use so the committee will email me.
They view it as mostly a noticeboard and thing "that is needed because everyone has a webpage"
Unfortunately after brainstorming with the crew (average age 68),
I have been informed that simply having a page is all they want. 
So this is all on me. 
No preference for styles/design/colors. 
2 requirements. 1 use the club logo. 
                2 Everything BIG because the users are old and needs glasses
                (unofficial request, check photos for anything unflattering)

## code from previous projects. 
I have used code from previous projects in the style.css.
it is the modifications to the <nav>. colors and orientation has been changed to show I understand how the code works.
